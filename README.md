# Premier Analysis  
#### Sean Browning, Scott Lee, Karen Wong  

  
Deep models using EHR data.  

## Data   

The required data is contained in a private submodule which can be recursively cloned when you pull down the repository (if you have access):  

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:cdcai/premier_analysis.git
```  

Alternatively, if you've already cloned the repository and didn't pull the submodule, you can update it from the project root:  

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
